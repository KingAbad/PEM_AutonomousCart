# PEM_AutonomousCart

PEM_Autonomous cart is the continuation of the subject **Project Reasearch** given by several professors of the university-college **PXL**. The main goal of Autonomous cart was to turn an ordinary golf cart into a fully self-driving campus taxi that takes it passengers to their desired locations. The three main technologies that were needed to make this project a succes were: IoT, AI and Automation technology. Our part on this project is to convert to cart so that it is automatized. This repo will hold everything that includes our part.
