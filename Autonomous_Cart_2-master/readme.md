# Project - Autonomous cart

Autonomous cart was one of the 3 main projects of the subject **Project Reasearch** given by several professors of the university-college **PXL**. The main goal of Autonomous cart was to turn an ordinary golf cart into a fully self-driving campus taxi that takes it passengers to their desired locations. The three main technologies that were needed to make this project a succes were: IOT, AI and Automation technology. As of our task to be the brain of this project it was our main responsibility to the IOT side of this project. And that is also what this repository is about.

 <p align="center"><img src="./readme_Images/ARDUINO_VERIFICATION_DEMO.jpeg"></p>

**Project requirements**
* Jumper wires
* RFID-RC522
* RFID tags
* IIC LCD-Display
* Buzzer module
* RGB led
* Breadboard
* Arduino IDE
* Arduino

**Step by step guide**
* Open the Arduino IDE. 
* Plug in your Arduino Nano (used by me) in your laptop.
* Start making your circuit (open my schematic).
* Copy and paste the my .ino code in your IDE.
* Look if you have the right board selected.
* Also select the right serial COM port your Arduino is connected to.
* Upload the code into your Arduino and it should work.

**Note:**
 You have to change the UID of mine tag to the UID of your tag.
To know this UID open one of the simple RFID-RC522 reading examples in the Arduino IDE.

  <p align="center"><img src="./readme_Images/PSOC_VERIFICATION_DEMO.jpeg"></p>
  
 **Project requirements**
* Jumper wires
* RFID-RC522
* RFID tags
* IIC LCD-Display
* Buzzer module
* RGB led
* Breadboard
* PSoC Creator 4.2
* PSoC 4

**Step by step guide**
* Open the PSoC Creator 4.2 download available at the official cypress site. 
* Import my project in the ide.
* If you are using a different PSoC you might have to change the target device and pin settings.
* Plug in your PSoC 4 (used by me) in your laptop.
* Start making your circuit.
* Clean and build the project once.
* Upload the code into your PSoC 4 and it should work.

**Note:**
 This code is made to work with any **RFID-tag** it just detects wheter any tag is detected by the reader or not.
 With some minimal changes to the code you can make it work for a certain specific tag.

<summary>Click to expand the RFID project with STM</summary> 
 
  <p align="center"><img src="./readme_Images/STM_VERIFICATION_DEMO.jpeg"></p>
 
 **Project requirements**
* Jumper wires
* RFID-RC522
* RFID tags
* IIC LCD-Display
* Breadboard
* STMCubeIDE 1.3.0
* STM32xxxx µController

**Step by step guide**
* Open the  STMCubeIDE 1.3.0 download available at the official st.com site. 
* Import my project in the IDE.
* If you are using a different STM you might have to change device with the board selector.
* Plug in your STMµController into your laptop.
* Start making your circuit.
* Clean and build the project once.
* Upload the code into your STMµContoller and it should work.

**Note:**
 You have to change the UID of mine tag to the UID of your tag.
To know this UID open one of the simple RFID-RC522 reading examples in the Arduino IDE.
And use it afterwards in the code. If you don't have the Arduino IDE then donwload an RFID reader
app on your smartphone it should work if your device supprots NFC.

  <p align="center"><img src="./readme_Images/Distance_Measurement_PSOC4.png"></p>
 
 **Project requirements**
* Jumper wires
* HC-SR04
* PSoC 4
* Breadboard
* PSoC Creator 4.2
* Serial monitor (UART)
* Digital caliper (optional)

**Step by step guide**
* Open the PSoC Creator 4.2 download available at the official cypress site. 
* Import my project in the ide.
* If you are using a different PSoC you might have to change the target device and pin settings.
* Plug in your PSoC 4 (used by me) in your laptop.
* Start making your circuit.
* Clean and build the project once.
* Upload the code into your PSoC 4 and it should work.
* Open your UART terminal eg. Tera Term and you should see your incoming output distance there.

**Note:**
 You can use the caliper to double check if the distance outputted by your ultrasonic sensor is correct or not.

## TCP-IP communication between Jetson and PLC

<details>
<summary>Click to expand the TCP-IP communication between Jetson and PLCs</summary> 

 <p align="center"><img src="./readme_Images/tcp_ip_Jetson_PLC.png"></p>
 
 **Project requirements**
* Jetson Nano
* Jetson Nano display
* Twincat 3 V4024.7

**Step by step guide**
* Open the Twincat XAE or open it in Visual Studio.
* Open the Twincat server project in your solution.
* Go on the Jetson Nano terminal and install python3.
* First run the PLC server on Twinact 
* now run the client program on the Jetson Nano.
* Now you should be able to see incoming messages in the server that you sent with the client.

**Note:**
 TwinCAT Error and Error ID are stored in the variable 'err' and 'errid' respectively. Some common errors found:
  * 8002 : Variable 'hSocket' is not populated with the correct address. The sequence is for the TwinCAT to call FB_SocketListen, the Python client to connect, and TwinCAT calls the FB_SocketAccept after that. This will populate the variable 'hSocket'. If FB_SocketAccept is called before the Python client trying to connect, it will throw 8002 error.
 * 8003 : The port is already opened. Reset Cold the TwinCAT program and Run again.
 * 6 : I don't know. Seems like there's something wrong with the installation of TF6310. Uninstall, reinstall, make sure that     TcpIpServer.exe is running in your Task Manager processes.
